This idea came to me in the midst of watching LTT in the background and probably getting more distracted than I should from whatever task I was doing. However, it combines two of my favorite things/hobbies, Rocketry, and PC hardware.

The Idea: Rocket engines run on an oxidizer and fuel. I have experience designing a rocket engine to use Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Kerosene (technically Jet-A/RP-1). In some rocket engines, the engine itself is cooled by flowing the propellant through a jacket around the engine to cool it (Regeneratively Cooled). What if you could use the same propellant that is cooling the engine, to also cool a PC.

Problems to solve: Cooling capacity of Kerosene, mass flow rates involved, size of rocket engine, pressurized pc cooling fittings, duration of operation to prove it works, cost (oh god cost).

But fuck it, I need to do something and get off my ass, so here is this.

Updates will mostly be posted at the bottom of this page and dated. If you are at all interested in following what happens here, there should be a subscription box/option somewhere on this page to subscribe to this project only via email updates 

(warning, if you subscribe to a specific project, and then subscribe to all projects at the bottom footer of this webpage, you will be emailed twice when ever I upload a project update. You can unsubscribe from specific lists, but I'm tired enough setting that whole custom system up so maybe I'll get around to figuring out how not to send duplicates automatically later, but for now this one's on you).

I'll gladly take any questions at my email [max@maxoberg.dev][email] or [twitter/X][twitter]
