I am applying to jobs. I also dislike applying to jobs and putting myself out there. So I decided to kill two birds with one stone. 

Behold, the vibecoded Job Application Tracker and CRM. It can
- Track companies
- Track Job Listings
- Track contacts at companies
- Set follow up reminders that can get emailed to you (when the app is running)
- Draft emails to contacts at companies
- Track contact activity wether its phone calls, interviews, emails, etc.
- Has the ability to export to excel, and you can import companies from an excel file too

And plenty other small nice to haves. This honestly has streamlined my application process in a nice visually pleasing way and has allowed me to really push my vibe coding experienece with different tools (Gemini cli, Cursor, Antigravity) to get a better understanding of how they work. 

I will not claim this is groundbreaking in any way. There are likely terribly cursed and redundant code blocks in here that should just not exist. But it works without super major bugs, and I figured out how to get it to auto update from github when new releases come out (something i didn't even know github enabled you to do). I want to post it here in case, with what ever reach I have on here, it helps someone.

So while my software engineer couple days are over, here's to hoping I land that job (and if any potential hiring managers are reading this, I won't let you down :D)

(For most people, just download the .exe file, it should install from there and take care of everything else you may need for getting it up and running)
