This project's goal is to create a written paper about pintle injector characteristics in a testing environment using pressurized water to somewhat match the Reynolds number of flow that is representative of an actual pintle rocket injector.

The goal is to characterize the changes in flows in a representative variable area pintle injector at different throttle rates. Checking for instabilities in the flow, mixing effectiveness, and momentum ratios Now, I am going to expand on all of this more later. However, For the initial part of this project , I will leave it updated with a document I created in an attempt to create a paper that can act as a general introduction to how to design a pintle injector, written so that you need basically no prerequisite knowledge beforehand.
