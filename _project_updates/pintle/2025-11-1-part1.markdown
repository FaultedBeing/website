## So You Want to Design a Pintle Injector

<span style="font-size: 100%;">An Introduction and Background </span>

<span style="font-size: 60%;"> (and way more details on how I designed an injector than you probably ever need, and yet, probably not enough details, all in the the context of a random rocket engine's development) </span>

By Max Oberg

<span style="font-size: 120%;">**Warning 1:**</span> This is the work of an amateur, I have done my best to create an accurate write up, but please take everything with a grain of salt. If you see any errors please reach out: max@maxoberg.dev . I will be striving to releases more versions when I find time as I fine tune this and can get other eyes on it.

<span style="font-size: 110%;">**Warning 2:**</span> Units are everywhere. I may be referring to kg in one section, and lbs in the next. I wish it wasn't this way, but I am lazy, and someone decided to ignore the French in the 1800s and now it's out of my hands. (Also, screw you 1950s paper on annular orifice discharge coefficients specifically).

**Note:** Any mention of "Herald" is referencing the original engine this injector was designed for, which was designed and developed by the PARSEC team at Caltech.

## Nomenclature

<span style="font-size: 100%;">Now, no paper with formulas should ever, in my opinion, be without this handy table below. I get so annoyed reading papers that assume I inherently understand the variables they picked. I am monkey who barely remembers to brush his teeth at night, If I am trying to learn from your paper, please don't make it harder than it needs to be. </span>

This small table below are variables specific to the 1950s paper found in Warning 2 above. Whether this paper us strictly necessary is definitely up for debate, however, I leave it here anyway.

Now, most if not all of the above terms will be described in due time, never fear!

## Introduction
---

            Every rocket engine will typically have a few preset parameters before you approach the design of an injector. Among these are: 

- Fuel and Oxidizer choice

- Mixture Ratio

- Mass Flow Rates of Propellants

- Chamber Pressure of the Rocket Engine

Before we use these values however, some aspects of fluids needs to be discussed.

            Injectors on a fundamental level are plates of metal with holes in them. Your shower head? An injector. Your sink faucet? An injector. Your sunscreen bottle? Yes, also an injector. So the basic question you must ask first when approaching the design of the injector, is how big should the holes in question be?

            With a certain set mass flow rate, density, and injection velocity, one can begin to calculate an ideal area for which the holes (or orifices) should be ideally size. This equation can be seen below:

$$Area = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho \cdot u} \tag{1}$$

            Now, there are some broad assumptions you are making to use the above equation (This equation is a conservation of mass equation, with the assumption that there is Steady, Uniform, and Incompressible flow). *However*, when fluid flows though an orifice, the effects of boundary conditions around the flow (the "walls" and edges of the hole/orifice), as well as entry/exit conditions  (feed pressure, exit pressure, whether the hole is a sharp edge or rounded) cause the ideal mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$) above to not accurately reflect reality. This results in a lower mass flow rate through the orifice than originally calculated. We call the ratio between the ideal flow and the actual flow the **Discharge Coefficient**.

$$C_d = \frac{Q_{\text{exp}}}{Q_{\text{ideal}}} \tag{2}$$

            The discharge coefficient is the ratio of the expected flow over ideal flow. For circular orifices, the simplified equation below is sufficient to represent the discharge coefficient. 

$$C_d = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho \dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho A u} = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho A \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho}}} = \frac{\dot{m}}{A \sqrt{2 \rho \Delta P}} \tag{3}$$

> <span style="font-size: 70%;"> The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_coefficient) for the equation above</span>

            A few assumptions must now be made to make forward progress using equation 3. In order to find A (the orifice area), and assumption for $C_d$ and an ideal $\Delta P$ value must be used. A $C_d$ for a circular orifice here can be assumed to be around .61 to start (an estimate based on previous experimental experience). The $\Delta P$ however, is more complex.

            $\Delta P$ is more typically called the **Stiffness** when dealing with injectors. The stiffness is the difference in pressure across the injector. More specifically, it is the difference between the combustion chamber pressure and the pressure in the main manifold* on the injector (on the other side of the injection orifice). 

> <span style="font-size: 90%;">*a manifold in this sense is a volume for fluid to fill and exists for (2?) main reasons. The first is to remove fluid flow affects from the small channels feeding into the injector. so instead of dealing with 48 separate flows, you can treat the fluid being injected into the rocket engine as if its coming from, in essence, a reservoir or tank. The second is to better circulate fluid across the back of the injector face in order to cool it.</span>

            Typically this value is around 20% for early rocket injectors, before they can be dialed into a lower % with testing.  One of the primary reasons you want your injector to have a certain level of stiffness is to avoid any backflow. This occurs when the propellant flow reverses across the injector, and propellant stops being injected to be combusted. Combustion gasses potentially turning your injector manifold into a new combustion chamber is, to say the least, not great!

            Additionally, if the stiffness is sufficiently low, a pressure wave could momentarily reverse the flow in the injector orifices. This causes an interruption to any propellant injection, and a momentary interruption to the combustion. This is a phenomenon known as **Chugging**. This typically will result in an oscillation in the chamber gases, that can severely affect your performance/controllability, and worse case scenario: destroy your engine. Further complications to stiffness in an engine arise when you throttle the engine.

#### Throttling

            When an engine is deigned to throttle, the mass flow rate is the variable that we are changing. This is done by 3 main methods:

###### 1) Upstream propellant throttling

            You can throttle a rocket engine by using a valve in the propellant feed system to change the mass flow rate that feeds the engine. A few rules of thumb for this "fixed area throttling" (not a super official term, but it is an important distinction), is that mass flow rate varies linearly with thrust, while pressure drop ($\Delta P$) changes as the square of flow rate. For example, a 50% reduction in thrust results in a drop from an an example 200psi $\Delta P$ to 50 psi $\Delta P$.

            For the fixed injector version of Herald, the engine is designed to throttle to 40% of its maximum thrust. As such, with an initial stiffness of 30% at maximum thrust, the stiffness at minimum thrust will be 12%. The 40% goal is only an ideal test stand target, but operationally the plan was to only use the engine down to 50% thrust in flight. Tuning the engine and figuring out what its true lowest operational stiffness can be is something that would be figured out once the engine was hot fired 

> author's note, I'll add examples of this in use in specific rocket engines in the future

###### 2) Neutral gas Injection

            This method involves injecting a neutral gas into the combustion chamber to decrease the engine's combustion efficiency. This gas is typically inert, such as nitrogen. However, in a vehicle's design, one might use whatever gas is being used to pressurize the tanks, which is
typically nitrogen or helium.

> repeat of the above note

###### 3) Variable Area Throttling

            The third option to throttle a rocket engine is by varying the injection orifice area to effectively change the mass flow rate at the point of injection. This makes an inherently more complex engine and injector, however, this gives you two significant advantages. The most significant one is the throttle range possible with the engine. 

            By changing the injection orifice areas, and not the feed pressure (as in type 1), you will be able to maintain a much higher stiffness value at much larger throttle percentages. This means for engines that need to perform complex maneuvers, having the capability to deep throttle is vital. This type of injector was specifically developed and put to use on the original Apollo Lunar Lander vehicle. The second advantage is the response time to throttle input. An upstream restriction on the propellant will take a measurable amount of time before a similar reduction in thrust, however, by throttling at the moment of injection, the response should be nearly instantaneous. This third throttling type leads us to, *finally*, the Pintle Injector

## Pintle Injector

---

According to all known laws of rocket science, the pintle injector is hands down the best injector of all time and nobody disagrees. We will be ignoring all claims otherwise and proceed with said pintle injector description now.

            The pintle injector was first developed at JPL in the midst of the rocket renaissance in the 1950s. The design would then get further developed by TRW over the next 30 years until it was acquired by Northrup in 2002 (the TRW sources about this injector also sort of just, stop, after this point. The amount of information on the internet lost due to company mergers like this is terrible. Aerojet Rocketdyne's website information is the same way). Perhaps the most famous use of the pintle injector was on the Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE) and on Space X's Merlin engines. 

            The pintle functions with two main components, the manifold body, and the pintle shaft. Propellant 1 is injected via an annular (circular) gap around the outside of the pintle shaft. This creates (typically)$^1$ a circular sheet flowing towards the rocket engine's throat/exit. Propellant 2 is injected via holes or slots (typically)$^2$ perpendicular to the flow of propellant 1. The two propellants will then impinge and mix, as shown in Figure 1 below.

> 1 - Pintle annular orifices could also be a circle of distinct orifices so instead of one contiguous sheet being injected, its N number of holes injecting down the shaft.

> 2 - This will be covered a little later, don't worry
